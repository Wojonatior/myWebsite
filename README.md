# myWebsite
This is the repo that contains my personal website. It's currently served with nginx, and deployed with docker. The current deployment process is to clone the repo locally, and then run `Docker-Compose up`. If you'd like to make changes to the html, you can edit the pug file, and then run the build script stored at the root of the project.
